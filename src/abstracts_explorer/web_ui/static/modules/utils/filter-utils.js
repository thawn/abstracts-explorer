/**
 * Filter Utility Functions
 * 
 * This module provides utility functions for working with filters.
 * Note: getSelectedFilters, applyYearConferenceFilters, and buildFilteredRequestBody
 * have been moved to api-utils.js to consolidate API-related utilities.

// This module is now deprecated - all filter utilities have been moved to api-utils.js
// Keeping this file for now to avoid breaking imports, but it can be removed in the future
